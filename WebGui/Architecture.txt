Let define Chain as what user chould create

==Data==

- Single chanin should contain Ids of categories mapped to a bookie
- If length of chain is less than available bookies, 
  it must be considered incomplete.
  
  Incomplete Chains can occur when user did not choose correspondin item(id) yet
  or when some of the bookie(s) are missing corresponding item(id)
  
  This is why incomple Chains are considered valid and can be used for their purpose.
  
==GUI==

DEFINITIONS

- "New Chain Initiator Row" NCIR - is row that has select elements for each
  bookie, with list of categories.
  
- "Chain Row" CR - is row that represent single Chain and has slects selements within.

LOGIC

- Gui should have list of current chains that is 
  (Possibly with filters to complete and incomplete)

- And also should have "New chain initiator row" NCIR that has select elements within,
  for each bookie.

- When user choses item within any selects of NCIR new CR is added 
  to chain list, with single item chosen and user should be able to 
  continue chosing other chain items(ids).
  
INTEGRITY AND VALIDATION

- When an item is chosen in a CR (Including initialy chosen item) for a bookie 
  it should be removed from initiator rows select element of that bookie.
  
  So at any point of time:
  - NICR selects should have all items except ones that are used by 
    any chains corresponding bookie.
    
  - CR selects should have all items except ones that are used by 
    any chains corresponding bookie, plus ones that are used by themselves.
    
    
ENHASEMENT
- Abiliti to search for an item to determine which hcain uses it.
